# maze-generator-solver
This project is an interactive maze generator and solver built using Python and Pygame. It creates mazes using Recursive Backtracking and Prim’s Algorithm and solves them with DFS, BFS, and A*. The system visualizes each step, helping users understand pathfinding and maze generation behavior
