Maze Generator & Solver
-----------------------

This project generates a maze using algorithms such as Recursive Backtracking and Prim's Algorithm. 
It solves the maze using DFS, BFS, and A* pathfinding. The entire process is visualized using Pygame.

Run with:
    python main.py

Controls:
    G - Generate (Recursive)
    P - Generate (Prim's)
    1 - DFS
    2 - BFS
    3 - A*
    R - Reset
    Q - Quit
